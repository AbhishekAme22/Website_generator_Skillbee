Introduction
This project is designed to generate multiple HTML pages using data fetched from an external API. 
It utilizes the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine for rendering the HTML templates. 
The generated pages are saved as individual HTML files for further use.

Prerequisites
Node.js v12 or higher
npm (Node Package Manager) 

Installation
Clone the project repository:
git clone <project_repository_url>
Install the project dependencies:
cd <project_directory>
npm install

Ignoring Dependencies
The project uses a .gitignore file to ignore the node_modules directory and the yarn's yarn.lock file. This prevents these large and automatically generated files from being included in the version control system (e.g., Git).
